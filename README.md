## What is an API?

## what is a Database?


## Installing MongoDB on Ubuntu

1. Go to [this link](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community)
2. Select your OS version
3. Click on `Download`
4. Click on the `.deb` file to install  
  4.1.  If you receive a message error saying that you need to install some `dependencies`, you can do it easily with `sudo apt install {dependecyName}`.  
  For example: `sudo apt install libcurl3`

Now you can verify if your installation was successfully:
1. Verify if you can start the database: `systemctl start mongod`
2. Verify if it was started: `systemctl status mongod`

## Installing a client for Mongo

1. Go to [this link](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/compass)
2. Select your OS version
3. Click on `Download`
4. Click on the `.deb` file to install  


## Creating a project
1. Create a folder for it: `mkdir myProjectName`
2. CD into it: `cd myProjectName`
3. Initialize it: `npm init -y`
4. Install the `mongodb` library so we can use it with code: `npm i mongoose@5.3.16`

## Learnig how to perform CRUD using `MongoDB`

CRUD is a acronym for `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`. These are the basic operations that we are going to perform on our Database.  
We need to be able to `CREATE` information and insert it on our database. After that, maybe we want to `READ` it and display to our users. If the users want to change it, we need to be able to `UPDATE` our database information, and if they do not like it, we will need to `DELETE` it.

1. Open the project with a code editor:  
`cd myProjectName && code .`
2. Create a file named `mongodb.js` for first tests and configuration
3. Add the content for initial configuration:
4. To run, just open the terminal and type `node mongodb.js`

```javascript
const moongose = require('mongoose')

// 1.
const connectionURL = 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/database-texts' 

moongose.connect(connectionURL, {
    useNewUrlParser: true,
    useCreateIndex: true // 2.
})

// 3.
const Text = moongose.model('Text', {
    title: {
        type: String,
    },
    text: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    size: {
        type: Number,
        required: true
    }
})

// 4.
let myTitle = 'History of super hero!'
let myText = 'My great text about heroes... Really Long...'
let sizeOfText = myText.split(' ').length 

// 5.
const willBeSaved = new Text({
    title: myTitle,
    text: myText,
    size: sizeOfText
})

// 6.
willBeSaved.save()
``` 
> 1. This URL is created by using the URL from the database (`mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017`) and the name that we want to give to our database (`database-texts`).
> 2. Just to make sure that our Database will create the correct IDs and Indexes.
> 3. Now we are **defining** a **Model** called Text. So, every time that we need to save a new Text, it will follow the same pattern and fields. This will be really useful for maintaining and organizing our Database. It is called Model because it is literally a Model that will be followed when we want to create a new **Text**. The appeareance is really similar to a Javascript Object or a C Struct, for example.  
> As an example of some rules, we are saying that the **text** and **size** are required, but the title is optional.
> 4. Just creating the variables that we will use to create a Text object and save in our Database. In a real application, problably a user would give this data to us.
> 5. Creating a Text object using our variables.
> 6. Now we are calling the method `.save()` on your **Text** object that were created by using our **Model**. Note that this is not a simple object, is a object from the **Text** model.

We actually can improve our model by adding some extra rules to it, like this: 
```javascript
const Text = moongose.model('Text', {
  title: {
    type: String,
    trim: true // 1.
  },
  text: {
    type: String,
    required: [true, 'Please, insert some Text!'],
    trim: true // 1.
  },
  size: {
    type: Number,
    required: true,
    min: [600, 'Size must be equal or bigger than 600'], // 2.
    max: [1000, 'Size must be equal or less than 1000!']  // 2.
  }
})
```
> 1. The trim property will remove extra spaces from our String. For example, if a user is trying to save a title like `'  My title '`, it will actually be saved as `'My Text'`.
> 2.  `min` and `max` will help us control the size. For example, remember that texts have a size rule? So we can apply it here and guarantee that all our saved texts have the minimum and maximum size. 

### **Search data**
After creating some objects in your database, maybe it is a good ideia discover how we can find those values and show to our users, for example. This is a simple task, and can be done as follow:

```javascript
willBeSaved.save().then(saved => { // 1.
  console.log(`We saved this Text: ${saved}`) // 2.
  let idOfSavedText = saved.id // 3.
  
  Text.findById(idOfSavedText).then(found => { // 4.
    console.log(`The same Text: ${found}`) // 5.
  }).catch(notFound => {
    console.log(`Failed to find: ${notFound}`) // 6.
  })

}).catch(failed => {
  console.log(`We have erros!: ${failed}`) // 7.
})
```
> 1. Now we are verifying if our object was successfully saved on our database. If everything was fine, we will receive a `saved` object that is a `Text` object with an `ID` and same fields that we give to it previously. 
> 2. This will show our `saved` object.
> 3. Fro this `saved` object, we are getting the ID that the database generated and saving it on `idOfSavedText`.
> 4. This is the function that does the job of searching a object by id: `Text.findById(...)` and we agora gonna use it to find the object that we saved some seconds ago.
> 5. If everything was fine, we will receibe the same object as we had before with `saved`.
> 6. If this was a real app, maybe a user was trying to find an object and search for the wrong id, so it will return an error.
> 7. This console will be printed if we had some validation errors or other problem.

To find all `Text`s is also really easy, we can do it with this code:
```javascript
Text.find().then(texts => { // 1.
  console.log(texts) // 2.

  texts.forEach(text => {
    console.log(text.id) // 3.
  })

})
```

> 1. We can use the method `.find()` to get all `Text`s. It will basically find all texts, because we are not using any filters, like .find({title: 'Harry Potter'})
> 2. This will be an `Array` of `Text`s. Example:  
`[{id: 1, title: 'abc'}, {id: 2, title: '123'} ...]`
> 3. We will print just the id of each `Text` that we found in our database.



### **Updating data**
Update information is a really important part, and it is really easy to do it. We can do it like this:
```javascript
const willBeSaved = new Text({
  title: 'A great Title',
  text: 'Long text...',
  size: 2
})

willBeSaved.save().then(saved => {
  console.log(saved.title) // 1.

  saved.title = 'My new Title'
  saved.save().then(updated => {
    console.log(updated.title) // 2.
  })
})
```
Now, if you verify in your Database using compass, or by using code with `.findById()`, you will see that the `title` changed from `A great Title` to `My new title`.

### **Delete data**
It is also a good ideia know how to remove data if it is not necessary or our user wants to, and we can do it like this:

```javascript
const willBeSaved = new Text({
  title: myTitle,
  text: myText,
  size: sizeOfText
})

willBeSaved.save().then(saved => {
  // 1. 

  // 2.
  Text.findByIdAndDelete(saved.id).then(deleted => {
    console.log(`I deleted this: ${deleted.id}`) 

    Text.findById(deleted.id).then(willBeNull => {
      console.log(willBeNull) // 3.
    })

  })
})
```
> 1. We are first saving a new object in our Database named `saved`. Lets imagine that after some time, the users wants to delete it. Then, we will do the code below 2.
> 2. We will call the method `findByIdAndDelete(id)` and this method will delete the object and also return a copy of it. (But the object is deleted!!! It is just a copy to display a last information of it)
> 3. If we try to find the object that we just deleted by it's `ID`, it will return a `null`, because it was previously deleted.
