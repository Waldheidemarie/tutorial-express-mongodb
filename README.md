## Who?
Hi there! My name is Vinícius Kammradt, I`ve been playing with technology since 2016. I really enjoy creating new stuff and also love to spread any knowledge that I have with others.  
Now, with help from [Gabriela de Almeida Riul](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriela-de-almeida-riul-2a1321184/), an Electrical Engineering student and also volunteear at [PET EEL](http://www.peteel.ufsc.br/), who is also interested in development, we will try to beat a challenge proposed by [Código Falado](https://github.com/codigofalado).

## What? *What will we build?*
The main idea of this project is to create a complete website to [this challenge](https://github.com/codigofalado/desafio333/blob/master/2020-Janeiro-Leitura-Organica/README.md). 
> O cliente (Leitura Orgânica) precisa de uma Landing Page para possibilitar que o usuário calcule sua velocidade de leitura.  

Our technical structure:
<div align="center">

</div> 

Our Vue.js website will be bassically a landing page that will use our API to get some information and also be able to manipulate it. We also need the API to be able to send e-mails, so we will use [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/) to do it.


## Why? *What is our objective?*
Our main objective is **learn**. After that, we want to be able to understand how a real website and API work, and after that, create our solution based on what we learned.   


## How? *What are the tools that we will use?*
We will use **Javascript** as our main programming language.  
So, to create our front-end we will use **Vue.js**. Primarily because it is an easy framework to start with and also really powerfull. To make stuff look better we will use **Vuetify**, a library that has styled components.  
We will also need some server-side processing to access the Database and send emails, so we will use **Express.js** to do that. This is a really easy to use framework that allows us to create endpoints and also trigger all other stuff that we need to do in the server.
